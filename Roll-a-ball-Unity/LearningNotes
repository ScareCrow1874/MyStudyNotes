############# ENVIRONMENTS #############
-- Setting environment with Unity editor
Can make folder names start with underscore to make sure they stay at top

-- MonoDevelop-Unity: C# IDE for unity
(Cmd + ') brings up the man page online

############# FUNCTIONALITIES #############
-- Focus on a game object
Select the object in the Hierarchy window, move the mouse over (don't click) the scene view, then press "F" key to focus on that object

-- Scaling objects
Select scale tool, 4th on the left, and drag the coordination/scale number panel or type number into scale number panel to scale objects

-- Creating a floor
Create ground by creating "plane" game object, deselect "Show Grid" in Gizmo drop menu to hide grid lines of the grey plane

############# OBJECT PROPERTIES #############
-- Unity Coordination
Red: x
Green: y
Blue: z

-- Plane
Plane is single-sided and has no volume and will not change on Y-axis. Changing Y-axis negative will change the plane to face down.

-- Prefab
An asset that serves as a template for multiple gameObjects, changes on which will be reflected on all its instances.
Prefab instances are shown in blue text in hierarchy view

-- Material
Used for adding texture and color to an object. Create a specific folder to hold your materials.
Use the Albedo's color picker to add color

-- Rigid Body Component
Necessary for using physics

############# SCRIPTING FOR UNITY ############# 
-- void Update()
Called before rendering a frame. Most of the game code goes here

-- void FixedUpdate()
Called just before physics operations. Physics code goes here.

############# TIPS, TRICKS AND PREFERENCES #############
-- Better default light for sphere
Position: 0,3,0
Rotation: 50,60,0
Scale: 1,1,1

-- Inspector ordering
From top to bottom: Transform, Sphere(Mesh Filter), Mesh Renderer, Rigidbody, Sphere Collider, Scripts, default material
