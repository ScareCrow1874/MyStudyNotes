-- Points and vectors and triangles
points are 3 coordinate entity, vector (line segment) consists of two points
triangle consists of 3 points. It's the major material for generating geometry

-- Triangulation and Tessellation
Tessellation: breaking object into polygons
Triangulation: breaking shapes into triangles
Polygons with n edges can needs n-2 triangles to represent it

-- Vertex ordering and culling
Backface culling: not render the faces that's hidden
Front-face triangle: counterclockwise vertex ordering, right hand rule
Back-face triangle: clockwise vertex ordering, left hand rule

-- Creating triangle with three.js
function exampleTriangle() {
	// This code demonstrates how to draw a triangle
	var triangle = new THREE.Geometry();
	triangle.vertices.push( new THREE.Vector3( 1, 1, 0 ) );
	triangle.vertices.push( new THREE.Vector3( 3, 1, 0 ) );
	triangle.vertices.push( new THREE.Vector3( 3, 3, 0 ) );
	
	triangle.faces.push( new THREE.Face3( 0, 1, 2 ) );

	return triangle;
}

-- Creating square with three.js
function drawSquare(x1, y1, x2, y2) {

	var square = new THREE.Geometry();
	// Your code goes here
    square.vertices.push( new THREE.Vector3(x1, y1, 0) );
    square.vertices.push( new THREE.Vector3(x2, y2, 0) );
    square.vertices.push( new THREE.Vector3(x1, y2, 0) );
    square.vertices.push( new THREE.Vector3(x2, y1, 0) );
    
    square.faces.push( new THREE.Face3( 0, 1, 2 ));
    square.faces.push( new THREE.Face3( 0, 1, 3 ));
    
	// don't forget to return the geometry!	The following line is required!
	return square;
}

-- Meshes
A polygon mesh is a collection of vertices, edges and faces that defines the shape of a polyhedral object in 3D computer graphics and solid modeling.
