-- Core concepts:
Refresh rate, frames per second(fps), the eye, pinhole camera, light frustum, light as physical and virtual, grapical pipeline, Painter's algorithm & Z-buffer

-- FPS, refresh rate
6 is the mininal FPS to not feel slowing down (about 166 ms to draw a frame)
60 provides smooth 
most computers in US has refresh rate of 60 Hertz - this means displays image 60 times per second
film usually has 24 FPS, but refresh rate can go up to 48 to 72 Hertz

-- 3D Scene
Objects, Lights and camera

-- Teapot model & Cubic Bezier Splines
By Martin Newell

-- GPU: Graphic Processing Unit
Application: express objects as triangles
Camera & Model transformation: check if the object is inside the view frustum
Rasterization: identifies all pixels whose center is inside a given triangle

-- pipeline and bottleneck
pipeline is a model of parallism
bottleneck is the slowest stage of a pipeline
starvation is when a later stage waiting for earlier stage to finish
stallation is when a earlier stage is stuck because a later stage is still processing

-- Painter's algorithm
sort objects based on theri distance from distant to near, then render the most distant triangle and then render closer ones
a flawed algorithm because it can run into cycles

-- Z-buffer
Store in each pixel not only the color but also a z-depth from 0.0 to 1.0. 0.0 is the closest to eye and 1.0 is the farthest
Z-depths are initialized as 1.0, and pixel shows the closest object's color
the predominant way of doing rasterization of triangles
3 cycles if reading from closer to farther: read destination(old) z-depth, write source(new) z-depth, write source color. Only 1 cycle is needed is the new object is farther: read destination z-depth. Therefore drawing objects from the front to back is the common way to optimize GPU

-- Web GL & three.js
Web GL is an API based on OpenGL ES, a mobile version of OpenGL. Their competitors are DirectX/Direct3D
Google Chrome turns WebGL commands into DirectX calls. 
Web GL is a state API, setup how you want GPU to do something, then send geographics to render under these conditions, providing fine-grain control over GPU. 
three.js provides many features that can simplify the process of using Web GL
