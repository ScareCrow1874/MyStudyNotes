General approach:
  1. turn color image into black and white
  2. label each object
  3. grab the object
  
Useful functions (graph specific): 
  1. [L,num] = bwlabel(___): label connected components in 2-D binary image, also returns the number of connected objects (fill in the line there with BW or (BW, n))

  2. imfill(BW, holes): Fill image regions and holes. A hole is a set of background pixels that cannot be reached by filling in the background from the edge of the image. (In the middle of the image)
  3. im2bw: change image to binary (black and white) image
  4. bwconncomp
  
General function notes:
  1. bsxfun: applies an element-by-element binary operation to arrays a and b, with singleton expansion enabled.
